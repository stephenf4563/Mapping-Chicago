# Mapping

Still working on building this one, Any comments or help would be appreciated. 

Essentially you have the html file that will allow you to display a mapping format, which will guide you throught he bus stops located in boston

The .css file will give you the padding and window size of the mapping app

lastly the .js will allow you to access the mapping function, this requires you to have an account on Mapbox and a valid key in order to populate. Head to Mapbox.com to sign up and generate thee key. 

Update** tried pulling in the class resolution files and still have trouble getting the app to work.
